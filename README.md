**Hey there!**

I'm Felicia, a Software Developer who enjoys teaching people about technologies through writing and Instagram. I am a professional Technical Writer and I have quite an interest in UX design, i believe that in order for the frontend developer to truly understand the product they must have basic understanding of UX design.
